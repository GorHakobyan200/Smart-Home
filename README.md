# Smart-Home

Main Files are face_rec.py and jarvis_vos.py.
ALl idea to control sensors of SMart Home via raspberry using voice commands and security system with face recognition.
With project I participated in many hackathon's and also exhibitions like DigiTec, and for my final work in collage.

Program starting with face recognition if its me face recognized and starting voice assistant ,if not its warn that unauthorized man there and saving his picture also sends me message.
With program you can ask for temperature and humidity via DHT11, open/close doors and turn off/on lights. Also you can ask for information to find and tell.
